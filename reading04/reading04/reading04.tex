\section*{Overview}

\paragraph{}

For this assignment, I parsed the a file of the demographics in order to create a
plot of the number of students of each gender per year in the CSE department and a 
plot of the number of students of each ethnicity per year in the CSE department. 
I discovered that the number of males dominates the number of females, but that
gap is slowly closing.  Also, the number of white people in our major dominates
the other ethnicities, but that gap does not seem to be closing.

% Methodology -----------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Methodology}

\paragraph{}

The method I used to extract the data was to determine the column based on the 
year using a modulo expression along with a simple subtraction expression, determine
the requested gender or ethnicity just by using the second parameter when calling
the count\_gender or count\_ethnic function.  In the function, I curled the given URL 
to get the {\tt demographics.csv} file and then redirected the error into /dev/null 
so the output would be clean and piped that into  while read LINE that used 
cut -d `,' -f ``\$column" piped to grep ``\$gender" to get all of the instances of the 
requested gender or ethnicity in a given year and then piped the while loop to 
wc -w to count the words. Once I had the scripts, there was no problem creating the 
graphs because of the given Makefile.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{}What is the overall trend in gender balance in the Computer Science and
    Engineering program at the University of Notre Dame?

The males dominate.

\item{}How has ethnic diversity changed over time in the Computer Science and
    Engineering program at the University of Notre Dame?

The amount of students overall has increased, but the Caucasian race still seems
to dominate the program

\end{enumerate}

% TODO: INSERT FIGURE

You should accompany these tables and graphs with some commentary on the
meaning of the data and plots.

\section*{Discussion}

\paragraph{}

% TODO: REMOVE and EDIT
This final section is an opportunity for you to reflect on the issue of
creating a {\bf welcoming} and {\bf supportive} learning environment at the
University of Notre Dame. For instance, you may wish to discuss any of the
following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{}Are the issues of gender and ethnic diversity important to you? Should
    the department work to increase diversity? Should the technology industry
    	try to improve workplace diversity? Why or why not?

I think that the department should leave it be because you do not want people in 
this program that are not fully invested in the program just to increase diversity, 
you should want people that are interested in the subject, no matter what their 
background is.  That also goes for the tech industry.

\item{}Does the Computer Science and Engineering department provide a welcoming
    and supportive learning environment to all students? In what ways can it
    	improve?

I think that it is a very welcoming community, I honestly do not know how to improve 
the learning environment because I think that it is great as is.

\item{}What challenges have you experienced thus far in the Computer Science
    and Engineering program? How could the department or university better
    	support you?

I think that one of the worst problems for the department is the FYS program.  If it 
were not for this program, we could have started CSE classes in our first year like 
most other schools and we would not have to play catch up for the rest of our college 
career.

\end{enumerate}
